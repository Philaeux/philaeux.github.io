## Old stuff with a new aspect

After a long time, I decided to build this new blog. The goal is the same, sharing content important to me: writing, computing, politics, poetry, video games, streaming...

From a technical point of view, I had a lot of troubles using Wordpress with the past blog, a huge piece of software for such a small product. I decided to switch to some other technology. d√©tails techniques.

## Static website, Jekyll and GitHub Pages

I discovered recently how to generate static websites using Jekyll and the integration inside Github pages. It simplify a lot the project, removing the database, saves, and turning everything into files. These files are then stored in a git repository, saved into Github.

With Github pages, the website is automatically generated after each commit and hosted. There is even a DNS setup to use a custom domain for such a website.

Overall, I think this is the best setup for a small personal blog. However, I am not a Jekyll expert so I do not know yet what's possible to do with the library.
